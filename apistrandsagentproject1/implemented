
Here’s what your application has implemented so far:

Strands Agent Integration: Your app uses a Strands Agent powered by OpenAI (gpt-4o) for chat, analysis, and tool use.
GitHub Access: The agent can list your GitHub repositories, analyze them (file types, stats), and read file contents using your GitHub token and username.
Session Management: Chat sessions are managed and stored, with the ability to list, retrieve, and export session data.
PII Redaction: Automatic detection and redaction of personal information (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.) before sending data to OpenAI, with reversible anonymization and audit trail.
S3 Storage Integration: Session and file data can be stored in Amazon S3.
File Upload: Users can upload files via the /api/upload endpoint for agent analysis.
Session Data Download: Users can download/export their chat session data via the /api/session/download/<session_id> endpoint.
Frontend UI: A modern chat interface is provided in templates/index.html.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation and guides are included in the documentation/ folder.
